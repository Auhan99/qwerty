During any disaster, there is lack of proper awareness and alerts, which in turn leads to massive destruction. Had there been awareness 
among people about the disaster , its impact could be reduced to some marginal extent.<br /><br>
Keeping this in mind, our main aim is to create a webapp which would be capable of following<br />
- Identifying two groups of people , the one who could be affected and the other who can help the affected ones, this identification
would be performed with the help of some modification in K-means. 
- The probable affected group would then get the regular alerts of the upcoming disaster.
- Next there would be updates for the steps taken by government.
- People of the affected area could mark them safe and unsafe, which would be of great help for their family and to reach them with a helping hand.
- A list of all the affected areas to be maintained.
- Updates of camp details
- Found/Lost person registry, where each one could help one
- A payment gateway, because in such a case donation could be of great help
- In the offline app there will be hacks that could be helpful during disaster ,sources may include ncc diaster management guides, basic medical aid that
 could be taken, past experiences of affected people from similar disaster, at the end knowledge is power.
